For <a href="https://medium.com/@munish.lohani/100-days-of-machine-learning-day-1-2-the-machine-learning-landscape-caf2d04ebb76" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">days 1–2</a>, I read about a couple of machine learning systems. Since I wasn’t done with the topic, I decided to read further on it, and here it is.</p> <h4><strong>Batch and Online Learning</strong></h4> <p><strong>Batch Learning</strong></p> <p>This type of machine learning process is incapable of learning incrementally. This means the model should be trained with all the data before being deployed. In such a system, the training process is done offline and then taken to production where no more training is done. But what if there is a change in scenario and we need to train again? In such a scenario, we would have to retrain the model from scratch. But worry not! This process can be automated.</p> <p><strong>Online Learning</strong></p> <p>Online learning is a process where we can train the model incrementally by feeding data instances sequentially or in batches. Such a system is really beneficial where a system constantly needs to receive data. One famous example of such learning is the stock market, where data changes very frequently.</p> <p>But this isn’t the only advantage of this system. It can also discard data once it has been trained. This is quite beneficial when the system lacks resources.</p> <p>Now that we know something about online learning, let’s go more into it. One of the parameters of this method is the learning rate (η). In simple words, the learning rate determines how quickly a model adapts to changes in data.</p> <p><strong>Higher Learning Rate</strong>: The higher the learning rate, the more quickly the system adapts to change, but at the expense of forgetting old data. This means the system is more sensitive to any noise.</p> <p><strong>Low Learning Rate</strong>: The lower the learning rate, the slower the system will adapt to change. But this also leads to more stability in learning as the system is less likely to be affected by noise.</p> <h4>Instance Based VS Model Based Learning</h4> <p>A way of categorizing machine learning systems is through how they generalize. Most machine learning models are about making predictions for examples they have never seen before. Having a good performance measure for training is good but not sufficient.</p> <p>There are mainly two ways to categorize ML models on how they generalize:</p> <p><strong>Instance-based learning</strong></p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1008/0*3bBdwg5DMvLyj154.png"></figure> <p>In this method, the system makes predictions based on similarity. This means the model compares the new data with the data it has been trained on and then makes a prediction. This is quite similar to ‘learning by heart,’ where the machine learns examples by ‘heart’ and then uses a similarity measure to compare. This method is also known as memory-based learning or lazy learning. One such example is KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors).</p> <p><strong>KNN:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <strong>Store Training Data:</strong> Firstly, the algorithm stores all the training data</li> <li> <strong>Determining K- neighbors: </strong>In this step, we determine the number of nearest neighbors we would be selecting to make prediction for our test data. The final result will be heavily influenced by the K-neighbors.</li> <li> <strong>Compute distances: </strong>The algorithm computes the distance between our test data and all the training data. Based on the value of K, it selects the ‘K’ number of distances based on their value.</li> <li><strong>Prediction:</strong></li> </ul> <p>§ <strong>Classification: </strong>For classification, the algorithm looks at the classes of the K nearest neighbors. Then, based on the frequency of these classes, it predicts the class for our output. It selects the most frequent class as the output.</p> <p>§ <strong>Regression:</strong> For regression, the algorithm takes the average of the K nearest neighbors. This value is used as the prediction for our test data.</p> <p><strong>Model-based Learning</strong></p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/637/0*6reZgoc9Hilq943X.png"></figure> <p>As mentioned in the title, model-based learning is about making an optimal model to generalize. In this method, an optimal model with parameters is created to make predictions. But the question is, how do we create the best model? This is done by tweaking our model parameters. But how? This is done via performance measures. One of the popular performance measures is the cost function. A cost function measures how bad a prediction is. It calculates the error between the predicted value and the true value. Using the cost function, the algorithm optimizes itself. It tries to lower the cost value by readjusting the parameters and repeating the steps until the cost function converges to the minimum value.</p> <p><strong>Reflection</strong></p> <p>For days 3–4, I briefly went through the concepts of some more machine learning systems. Based on this knowledge, the further blog will be about a project on these topics.</p> <p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=1386ca72c91f" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p> </body></html>
